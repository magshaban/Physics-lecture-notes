# What is this folder?

In case of some lecture notes/guides the source `.tex` files were lost for *mysterious reasons* (say). These files have no hope on this repo as they cannot be edited in anyway with either corrections or improvements.

You are invited to contribute by preparing `.tex` files for these notes. The `.tex` files *need not be designed to look like these finished products*, they simply need to have all the same content (most of the english can be copied and pasted over) so that they become flexible for future edits.
