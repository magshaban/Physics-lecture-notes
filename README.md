# Physics lecture notes

**Lecture notes in physics, for undergraduate and postgraduate topics, with exposition based on classes taught. Always a work in progress, opened for public collaboration in 2020.**

### What is this?

This collection of documents started off as a series of notes made from lectures delivered while teaching postgraduate and undergraduate classes in physics. Although the notes themselves [have been available online](https://vhbelvadi.com/teaching) for years the source files for a large bunch (not all) of them were opened to public contribution in 2020 and this repo was born.

### How *you* can contribute

There are three ways in which you can contribute to this repo:

1. **The quick way.** Open an issue if you have suggestions or ideas, if you spot errors, if you have requests etc. but cannot contribute by yourself. In short, if you want to add to this repo but do not have the time or inclination to do the work yourself, open an issue and someone will address it soon.

2. **The real way.** If you feel like an (or a bunch of) improvement(s) can be made to existing content, or if you spot errors, or if there are problems you would like to suggest or solve, or code, or ... well, anything at all, then simply fork this repo, make your edits and submit a pull request.

3. **The explorerâ€™s way.** If have any new topics you would like to write about, or if you would like to help by completing one of the projects in the [TODO folder](https://github.com/vhbelvadi/Physics-lecture-notes/tree/master/TODO) that are output pdfs that are missing source files (and are therefore impossible to edit further), fork this project and submit a pull request.

### The existential question

There are no grand plans for this repo. The intentions behind sharing current iterations of these notes have always been humble: to make some academic discussions available for other academics, for students and for the public.

The same intentions carry over to this repo: it exists because, while one person can make certain notes, ten people can improve upon it. With students and fellow academics suggesting improvements, pointing out errors, and generally collaborating and improving these notes, we will all benefit from better reading materials and learn new things in the process.

Nobody ever grew by keeping knowledge to themselves.

#### Contribution license

See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/vhbelvadi/Physics-lecture-notes/blob/master/LICENSE) for details.

Regardless of contributions this repo will be maintained as long as the repo owner keeps delivering lectures in physics classes. That said, collaborating can be fun and rewarding so why not do it?
